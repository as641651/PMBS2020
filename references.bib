	abstract = {Mobile applications are becoming increasingly ubiquitous and provide ever richer functionality on mobile devices. At the same time, such devices often enjoy strong connectivity with more powerful machines ranging from laptops and desktops to commercial clouds. This paper presents the design and implementation of CloneCloud, a system that automatically transforms mobile applications to benefit from the cloud. The system is a flexible application partitioner and execution runtime that enables unmodified mobile applications running in an application-level virtual machine to seamlessly off-load part of their execution from mobile devices onto device clones operating in a computational cloud. CloneCloud uses a combination of static analysis and dynamic profiling to partition applications automatically at a fine granularity while optimizing execution time and energy use for a target computation and communication environment. At runtime, the application partitioning is effected by migrating a thread from the mobile device at a chosen point to the clone in the cloud, executing there for the remainder of the partition, and re-integrating the migrated thread back to the mobile device. Our evaluation shows that CloneCloud can adapt application partitioning to different environments, and can help some applications achieve as much as a 20x execution speed-up and a 20-fold decrease of energy spent on the mobile device.},

	abstract="Smartphones are a new kind of mobile devices that allow users to take their office anywhere and anytime with them. The number of smartphones is rapidly growing. Most of the time their capabilities are underused, therefore several authors have studied how to exploit smartphones for assisting scientific computing. Yet, as far as we know, there is no study aimed at determining whether smartphones can do a significant contribution to this area as resource providers. This paper shows that smartphones are not that slow when compared to standard mobile devices, such as notebooks. Furthermore, a notebook running on battery only performed 8 times more work than a low-end smartphone before their batteries run out. However, the low-end smartphone is 145 times slower than the notebook, and the smartphone battery has less capacity than the notebook battery. Since smartphones can execute large amount of work running on battery, we think that smartphones can have a major role in building the next-generation HPC infrastructures.",
